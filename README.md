## Overview

This project provides an AI-driven risk assessment tool that uses advanced Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning and internet research to evaluate business risks. It integrates industry-standard frameworks such as ISO 31000 and COSO ERM to offer actionable risk mitigation strategies. The tool is built with a user-friendly Gradio interface, making it accessible to decision-makers who need real-time risk insights for scenarios like market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.

## Why It Matters in Real Life

Businesses operate in an increasingly complex environment where unexpected risks can disrupt operations. By using AI to systematically break down and analyze risk factors, this tool helps organizations:
- **Proactively Identify Risks:** Quickly recognize potential financial, operational, strategic, and compliance-related risks.
- **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Tailor risk mitigation plans that are both cost-effective and aligned with proven risk management frameworks.
- **Enhance Decision-Making:** Leverage real-world business cases and advanced risk modeling techniques to support critical business decisions.
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** Utilize a local Large Language Model (LLM) to keep sensitive data secure and maintain ethical AI use.

## Code Details

### Key Components:
- **Model Initialization:**  
  The tool uses the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` model from Hugging Face. It securely sets the token as an environment variable to authenticate the model retrieval.
  
- **Risk Assessment Prompt:**  
  A detailed prompt is defined to guide the model in evaluating risks. This prompt includes:
  - **Risk Identification & Categorization:** Examining risks across various business domains.
  - **Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Step-by-step evaluation using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
  - **Mitigation Strategy Development:** Recommendations aligned with risk management standards.
  - **Performance Evaluation:** Setting KPIs and frameworks to assess the quality of AI-generated insights.
  
- **AI Functionality:**  
  The function `ai_risk_assessment` takes a new business use case as input, appends it to the structured risk prompt, and uses the model to generate a detailed risk assessment. The function also supports GPU acceleration if available.
  
- **Interactive Gradio Interface:**  
  A Gradio-based UI lets users input a business scenario and receive an AI-generated risk assessment in real time. This interactivity makes the tool practical for live risk evaluation sessions.
