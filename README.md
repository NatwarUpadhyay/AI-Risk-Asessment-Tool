# AI-Driven Risk Assessment Tool

## Introduction
### Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven risk assessment tool leveraging Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning and internet research to evaluate business risks, such as market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. The model adheres to structured risk analysis methodologies like ISO 31000 and COSO ERM to provide actionable mitigation strategies.

### Business Focus
The goal is to enable businesses to proactively identify and mitigate risks, ensuring operational continuity and minimizing disruptions.

## Deliverables
- AI-driven risk analysis and mitigation framework.
- Business case studies with real-world risk evaluations.
- Performance assessment framework for AI-generated risk insights.

## Technical Details
### Local LLM Benefits
Using a local Large Language Model (LLM) ensures higher data integrity and ethical AI use, keeping sensitive business data secure from open-source models.

### AI Fine-Tuning Parameters
By leveraging hyperparameters such as:
- **Top-p**: Controls nucleus sampling for better response diversity.
- **Temperature**: Adjusts randomness in AI-generated responses.
- **Maximum length**: Defines the response size limit.

These parameters enable the model to produce highly relevant, production-level risk assessments.
